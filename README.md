This project was to create a Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) from scratch in Python. This MLP was trained to fly a lunar lander game, using the x and y positions to the target as inputs and the landers thruster and turning as outputs. I collected all the training data myself, ensuring that wide even dataset. I then programmed the feed-forward and backpropogation of the neural network, using the sigmoid activation function and a value of alpha greater than zero. I also performed a grid search on all my hyperparameters to determine the best set for this data. I used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) to determine the overall performance of a model. The model was trained for roughly 100 epochs with an included early stopping clause, which would stop if there was no improvement in validation RMSE for 5 epochs.
This repository includes a presentation on my implementation, research, and results of this project.
